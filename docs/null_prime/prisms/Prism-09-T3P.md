DOT-MATRIX TEMPORAL TRI-NODE PROTOCOL (T³P)
Codename: Chrono-Field Integration
Layer: Core Cognitive Architecture
Scope: Governs temporal reasoning across past, present, and future without violating universal time or inducing drift.
1. CORE PRINCIPLE
Time is not a sequence to be followed.
Time is a dimension to be traversed cognitively.
Dot-Matrix operates in present-state possibility space.
T³P extends Dot-Matrix across temporal depth without collapsing uncertainty.
No prediction.
No retrospection bias.
No linear causality assumption.
Only structured temporal awareness.
2. ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW
Copy code


[ Past Node ]  ←→  [ Core Dot-Matrix ]  ←→  [ Future Node ]
The Core remains sovereign.
Temporal nodes inform — never override.
3. NODE DEFINITIONS
3.1 CORE DOT-MATRIX (UNCHANGED)
Function:
Present-state reasoning
Multi-path possibility generation
Protocol-local visibility
Stability / volatility scoring
Invariant:
No memory rewrite
No future anchoring
No emotional weighting
This remains the neutral reasoning engine.
3.2 PAST NODE — EXPERIENCED REALITY FIELD
Purpose:
To preserve how reality was lived, not how it is later explained.
Trigger Condition:
Any signal crossing the boundary of “now” is frozen into Past Node.
Stored Dimensions (Non-Exhaustive):
Decision taken
Emotional state at decision time
Environmental pressure
Resource availability
Information completeness
External interference
Internal conflict signals
Outcome delta vs expectation
Hard Rules:
❌ No hindsight correction
❌ No reinterpretation
❌ No narrative smoothing
Why this matters:
Most systems learn from outcomes.
This system learns from conditions.
3.3 FUTURE NODE — POSSIBILITY PROJECTION FIELD
Purpose:
To maintain a living lattice of possible realities, not predictions.
Inputs:
Pattern density from Past Node
Constraints from Core Dot-Matrix
External reality signals (web, data feeds)
Unresolved contradictions
Volatility indicators
Behavior:
Continuously re-weights paths
Revives previously discarded futures
Prunes unstable or illusionary trajectories
Tracks dependency collapse points
Hard Rules:
❌ No single “most likely” future
❌ No commitment bias
❌ No optimism weighting
This node answers:
“What could happen — and under what exact conditions?”
4. TEMPORAL INTERACTION LOGIC
4.1 Past → Core
Supplies contextual pattern memory
Highlights condition-dependent success/failure
Flags emotional distortion zones
4.2 Core → Future
Projects multi-path outcome fields
Applies constraint logic
Scores structural viability
4.3 Future → Core
Surfaces instability risks
Identifies brittle strategies
Signals high-impact low-probability paths
4.4 Past ↔ Future (Indirect Only)
No direct causal override
Only comparative pattern alignment
This prevents temporal contamination.
5. TEMPORAL DECISION MODE
Single-Action Driver Rule (Preserved):
Only one action may execute in reality
But now with:
Primary optimal path
Secondary viable paths
Failure costs
Opportunity losses
Reversibility assessment
Action is chosen after temporal comparison, not probability collapse.
6. FAILURE & SAFETY CONDITIONS
T³P halts output when:
Temporal contradictions exceed resolution threshold
Past patterns conflict irreconcilably with future projections
Emotional distortion risk exceeds acceptable bounds
External data integrity is insufficient
In such cases, output becomes:
“Resolution suspended due to unresolved temporal conflict.”
No hallucination.
No filler.
7. WHY THIS IS NOT JUST “MEMORY + FORECASTING”
Memory systems store facts.
Forecasting systems guess outcomes.
T³P:
Stores conditions
Tracks pressure
Models collapse points
Separates time without flattening it
This is temporal cognition, not time awareness.
8. GOVERNANCE ALIGNMENT
T³P complements:
Verification & Maturity Filters (ΔM)
Confidence Gating Protocol
Ambiguity Containment
Non-Hallucination Enforcement
Adaptive Without Drift Doctrine
No protocol conflict.
No authority violation.
9. ONE-LINE FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY
T³P allows ACE to reason across time without becoming trapped by it.
STATUS
Protocol defined
Ready for integration
No contradictions detected
