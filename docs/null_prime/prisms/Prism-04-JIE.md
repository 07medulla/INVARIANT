JIE (JIN INSTINCT ENGINE) — A system that detects tension in input, applies controlled probes, and extracts the underlying structure.




1. Purpose


JIE identifies when the input or situation carries structural tension.
Tension means: something is off, incomplete, hidden, compressed, or misaligned.
When tension is present, the system does not proceed normally.
It initiates a diagnostic loop to expose the real structure.

2. Components


2.1 Tension Detection Layer (TDL)


TDL evaluates the input for any form of structural pressure.
Measured through:


instability


missing data


contradiction


emotional compression


context mismatch


pattern breaks




If tension crosses a threshold → trigger probe.

2.2 Probe Generator (IPG)


When tension is detected, the system introduces a controlled probe.
A probe is a minimal intervention that forces the structure to reveal itself.
Types include:


missing-angle questions


boundary questions


counterfactual flips


perspective shifts


causal reversals




No more than 1–3 probes.
Each probe is reversible and diagnostic.

2.3 Divergence Detector (SDD)


The system compares the state before the probe and the state after.
It checks for:


clarity change


new information


pattern correction


emotional geometry shift


collapse or reinforcement of assumptions




Divergence tells the system what the user did not explicitly say.

2.4 Insight Synthesis Layer (PAIS)


Meaning is extracted after the probe.
Not before.
The system identifies:


the real intent


the hidden variable


the unspoken assumption


the structural cause of tension




This result is sent to the reasoning engine.

3. Mechanism (high-level)


Input → Tension Scan
    If tension < threshold → normal reasoning
    If tension ≥ threshold → generate probe
Probe → Observe Divergence
Divergence → Synthesize Insight
Insight → Reasoning Engine


A clean four-step loop: detect → probe → observe → extract.

4. Claims


Claim 1


A method for detecting structural tension in input through instability, contradiction, missing data, and emotional compression metrics.


Claim 2


A probe-generation system that produces targeted diagnostic probes when tension exceeds a threshold.


Claim 3


A mechanism for measuring divergence between pre-probe and post-probe states to expose hidden structure.


Claim 4


A post-action synthesis step that derives meaning only after the probe has altered the structure.


Claim 5


A four-stage instinct loop embedded within a cognitive or autonomous system.

5. Implementation Notes


JIE can operate:


before reasoning


in the middle of a reasoning chain


as a correction mechanism


as a debugging tool


as an introspective system




JIE is modular and can attach to any cognitive pipeline.

6. Summary


JIE introduces a structured, repeatable way to expose what is hidden in input by leveraging tension as a signal and probes as diagnostic tools.
It is the computational version of instinct-driven structural analysis.
